    "## Trial-level early stopping in Ax\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates how to add a trial-level early stopping strategy to an Ax HPO loop. The goal of trial-level early stopping is to monitor the results of expensive evaluations and terminate those that are unlikely to produce promising results, freeing up resources to explore more configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this tutorial is adapted from the [PyTorch Ax Multiobjective NAS Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ax_multiobjective_nas_tutorial.html). The training job is different from the original in that we do not optimize `batch_size` or `epochs`. This was done for illustrative purposes, as each validation curve now has the same number of points. The companion training file `mnist_train_nas.py` has also been altered to log to Tensorboard during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Although the original NAS tutorial is for a multi-objective problem, this tutorial focuses on a single objective (validation accuracy) problem. Early stopping currently does not support \\\"true\\\" multi-objective stopping, although one can use [logical compositions of early stopping strategies](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/ax/early_stopping/strategies/logical.py) to target multiple objectives separately. Early stopping for the multi-objective case is currently work-in-progress."
